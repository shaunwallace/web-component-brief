web-component-brief
===================

*Code demos showing how web components can be used in the wild.*

**NOTE**: This is a living project that will be updated over time. For now the main focus will be explaining why Web Components exist as well as providing some simple examples of how they might be implemented.


This brief will explore Web Components, their parts and pieces, the problems they attempt to alleviate, how they are currently being implemented across browsers, and how they are/will integrate(d) with other frameworks that contain similar paradigms, namely Angular and itâ€™s directives. The brief will include working code examples using the current Web Component Specifications outlined at http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/, Polymer, and X-Tags.
